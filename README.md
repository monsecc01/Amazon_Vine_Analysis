# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Resources



## Overview of the analysis: 
The Amazon Vine analysis was performed to determine if there is bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members. We specifically looked at the US Shoes Amazon reviews dataset. 
We used PySpark to perform two technical technical analysis to better understand the data:
* ETL on Amazon Product Reviews (etract amazon dataset, transform/clean the data in a dataframe, and load into pgAdmin)
* Calculating review metrics

## Results: 
Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
* 
* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

## Summary: 
In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
